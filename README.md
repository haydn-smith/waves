# Haydn's Phaser Starter

This is the boilerplate I use to create video games with [Phaser](https://phaser.io/).

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install project dependencies. |
| `npm run dev` | Launch a development web server. |
| `npm run build` | Create a production build in the `dist` folder. |
| `npm run lint` | Lint the codebase. |
| `npm run typecheck` | Check the codebase for type errors. |

Explore adventure, friendship, and
kindness as a very smol penguin,
making waves in a very big world.
