# 1. Spring

We fade in.

*Player Penguin* is asleep in a clearing. They wake up, then enthusiatically wave at the camera. The player can move
down a hallway where another pengion, *Other Pengion* is blocking the path. *Other Pengiun* initiates a conversation.

*Other Penguin:*

```
Oh - hi!

It's that time of year, you know?

...

Time to migrate! All the fish in the ocean wont eat themselves!
```

*Player Penguin* follows *Other Pengiun* to the jetty.

*Other Penguin*
```
You're that one penguin, aren't you?

The one with one more thing left to do.

What can one small penguin do against the adversities of the antarctic?

Oh well.

Good luck!
```

*Other Pengiun* jumps off the jetty and swims off screen.

*Player Pengiun* walks through another clearing, interacting with items as they go.

They reach a final clearing, with many dead plants. At the end of the clearing is a single alive plant. *Player Pengion*
interacts with it.

*Player Penguin*
```
These plants have passed away.

They can't stand the harshness of winter alone.

This one is still hangin in there!

...

But it needs water.
```

*Player Pengiun* then waters the plant, and then sits down in front of the plant. We fade to black.

# 2. Summer

*Player Penguin* wakes up from their sleep and waves enthusiastically at the camera. They go to the clearing the plant is in, but it is blocked by some ice. There is an ice cube with a face in the clearing, along with several oscilating fans positioned slightly behind them.

*Ice Cube*
```
Uhm, hello.

I seem to be in a bit of a pickle.

You see, summer is hot...

And I'm melting away!

If you could blast some cool air on me from these fans, that would sure cool me down.
```

*Player Penguin* turns on all the fans, and they end up pushing *Ive Cube* really fast into the ice wall, smashing it!

*Player Penguin* can now go into the clearing with the *Alive Plant*, where *Ice Cube* has ended up. They talk to *Ice
Cube*:

*Ice Cube*
```
Whoa! That was crazy cool!

So cool...

...That I have now cooled down.

Yep, it's gonna be a nice, cool, summer.

Thanks for the help little pal!
```

*Player Pengiun* then waters the flower, then sits down.

We fade to black.

# 3. Autumn
*Player Penguin* wakes up from their sleep and waves enthusiastically at the camera. They go to the clearing the plant is in, but the way no longer exists! A new clearing can be entered.

Upon entering the new clearing, there is a snowball in the way. It can be pushed out of the way to enter the clearing.

There are other snowballs in the clearing. Pushing them all together builds a snowman! The snowman is magic, and created
a new pash to the flower clearing.

*Snowman*
```
Oh jolly good!

That was a bit of a bother being in bits like that!

You seem like a good chap, helping me out of a tough spot there.

Cheerio!
```

The player waters the plant and sits down.

We fade to black.

# 5. Winter
*Player Penguin* wakes up. It's storming! The camera shakes and particles cover the screen. They panic at the camera, and run to the clearing. The wind picks up on the way to the clearing, and they struggle to get to the flower.

Upon reaching it, we see there is a little wind break set up for the flower. *Player Penguin* waters the plant, and we
fade to black as they do it.

# 6. Spring... Again
*Player Pengiun* wakes up in their usual spot. They do not wave at the camera.

They go to the clearing, but it is completely blocked off by snow.

They talk to the snowman:
```
Hello old chap!

The winter has fundamentally changed the way the snow lives and speaks to me.

...

I cannot move it.

...

Look around though, kid. Look at the good you've gotten up to!

I can't think of a more splendid friend one could have.
```

They talk to the ice cube:
```
Oh... Hi!

These seasons have been crazy!

But we've had each other.

I wouldn't even know anyone if it wasn't for you!

One must imagine...

...How our actions start as ripples...

...Then become waves...

...That effect everything around us...

...

...So cool!
```

Once both friends have been talked to, All three walk up the jetty.

*Ice Cube*
```
It's time to migrate, my friend!

I'll see ya... when I see ya!
```

*Snowman*
```
We'll miss you, but by golly, our paths will cross again.

Tally-ho!
```

The *Player Penguin* jumps into the water and swims away, as the camera pans to the clearing of the *Alive Plant*.

It has flowered.

We fade to black.
